    <!--
          This is an additional OpenVPN 3 Linux D-Bus policy
          needed on most distributions for the time being.

          For some reason on these distribution versions
          the 'at_console' policy is needed as the default
          context does not properly handle receive_*
          rules.

          This is needed to allow log forwarding which are
          requested via net.openvpn.v3.sessions but
          delivered by net.openvpn.v3.log to another
          log listener, typically without a well-known
          busname.

          This tweak is kept in a separate policy file
          as the logging implementation need to be further
          improved to avoid this policy requirement.
